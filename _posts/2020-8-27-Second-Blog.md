title: R or other languages?
---

I think R includes comprehensive functions to analyze data. I have used Python before. Comparing with other software, R has various libraries that contain different statistical formulas. That is convenient for me as a student major in Statistics. I feel Python is also a clear programming language to build some small applications. R is better if people need to build a statistical model. I can use R to clean, transform, and use the built-in functions to analyze the data. However, Python is more consise. For example, writing the loop function in Python is easier than in R. When I first learnt R, I used R to write my homework in my undergraduate statistic class. That was my first time using software and wrote code so I thought using R was a difficult thing at first. After I can build some statistical models in R, I felt some challenges because there were many settings in each function that can change your final result if you did not set correctly. In order to get a better vision of homework, I tried to use R markdown when I used R at the first time. After I used it more frequently, R was not a hard one, but Python was another big challenge for me.

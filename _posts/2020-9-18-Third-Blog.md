**About my Project 1**

1.	Explaining what you did in the project and any findings you made

I first connected my R studio to Git, and this is my first-time using R studio to create a repo. Then, I started to create my vignette. I wrote multiple functions to connect NHL record API and NHL stats API, so the users can get the data sets they wants. Next, I wrote the wrapper function to make those functions together and made life easily. Using these functions, I can query the data and do some exploration. Based on the knowledge I have studied in this course, I followed the instruction to join two datasets, create some new variables, create contingency tables, create summaries and create some graphs. Most of the knowledge was used during this process. Finally, I can create the repo on github. I found that although I have done most of the similar work in my homework assignments, it still difficult to do them in bigger dataset or complicated assignments. Practice is very important to be a real statistician.

2.	 You should also reflect on the process you went through for this project. Discuss things like:

– what would you do differently in approaching the project?

First and the most important thing, I would start it early. I would clarify the true purpose of the requirements in the instruction at first, not write the code without clear understanding. 

– what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for you?

The most difficult part of the logic and programming for me is that writing functions. Especially for NHL stats API. Because I am not familiar with NHL, I cannot well understand each variables in the data, and I am not sure about the meaning of terms, such as vignette, modifier, endpoint, etc. That is another big obstacle for me. 

– what are your big take-aways for future projects?

How to well understand the instruction, how to well instruct the function, and how to well used Github. 

Here is my [vignette](https://yuyaooo.github.io/Poroject1/).

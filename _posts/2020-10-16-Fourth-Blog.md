# About my Project 2

The project 2 creates predictive models to predict number of shares of [online news popularity data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity) using multiple variables and automate seven markdown reports for every day of week. For now, I use two nonlinear model which are regression tree and boosted tree. Then, we can compare these two models using some statistics such as RMSE or MAE to choose the more accurate one. 

# Discussion

**What would you do differently?**

I would use PCA or other model selection method to choose less variables but get more information about the data. 

**What was the most difficult part for you?**

The most difficult part is automating. This is the first time I use automation. Due to the large amount of samples, it takes long time to automate seven reports. I am afraid that I cannot get the right form of reports after I spend one hour running the code. 

**What are your big take-aways from this project?**

The big take-aways is how to use different models to analyze the real life data. This online news popularity dataset has almost 40 thousand samples and 61 variables. I may not use all of variable, so I should use some information to choose some of them.
